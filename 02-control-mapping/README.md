# 02 – Control Mapping

This section documents how internal system controls are mapped against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and internal policy requirements. It identifies existing safeguards, uncovers gaps, and provides a foundation for risk-based audit testing.

## Objectives

- Map current controls to the NIST CSF functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
- Evaluate coverage of security policies, procedures, and technical implementations
- Identify missing, outdated, or ineffective controls
- Align control mappings with business objectives and compliance requirements

## Approach

Control mapping will be performed through:

- Review of internal policies and SOPs
- Interviews with control owners
- System configuration documentation review
- Validation through technical testing (in fieldwork phase)

## Example Control Categories

| NIST Function | Control Category              | Example Controls                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Identify      | Asset Management               | Asset inventory, classification standards |
| Protect       | Access Control                 | RBAC, MFA, account review procedures       |
| Detect        | Anomalies and Events           | IDS alerts, log monitoring                |
| Respond       | Response Planning              | Incident response playbooks, on-call SOPs |
| Recover       | Recovery Planning              | Backup validation, disaster recovery test |

## Deliverables

- Control Mapping Spreadsheet (NIST CSF vs. Internal Controls)
- Gap Analysis Summary
- List of Controls Requiring Field Validation
- Input for Risk Register and Remediation Plan
