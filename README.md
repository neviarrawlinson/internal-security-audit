# Internal Security Audit

An enterprise-style internal security audit project aligned with NIST guidance and cybersecurity governance best practices.

## Overview

This hands on project simulates a real world internal audit engagement led by a cybersecurity risk and governance leader. It blends technical execution with strategic oversight to demonstrate how internal audits drive business alignment, compliance, and continuous improvement.

The audit approach is based on:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- NIST SP 800-53 Control Families
- Industry audit standards (ISO 19011)
- Practical governance and risk management principles

## Key Objectives

- Scope and plan an internal audit with business impact in mind  
- Map security controls to NIST standards and identify compliance gaps  
- Analyze policies, procedures, and system configurations  
- Provide findings, risk ratings, and actionable recommendations  
- Demonstrate audit lifecycle, stakeholder reporting, and follow-up
