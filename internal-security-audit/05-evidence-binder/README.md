# 05 – Evidence Binder

This module organizes supporting audit evidence to demonstrate compliance and control effectiveness. It ensures that documentation is accessible, reviewable, and aligned with findings and recommendations.

## Objectives

- Centralize screenshots, logs, policy documents, and testing outputs
- Link each piece of evidence to corresponding audit findings
- Create a professional and reviewable binder structure

## Structure

Organize evidence using a consistent folder or labeling system:
evidence/
├── access-control/
│ ├── user-access-review.png
│ ├── mfa-policy.pdf
├── endpoint-protection/
│ ├── antivirus-config.json
│ └── device-enrollment-log.txt
├── incident-response/
│ ├── IR-policy.pdf
│ ├── SOC-alert-export.csv

## File Types

- Screenshots (JPG, PNG)
- Logs (TXT, CSV)
- PDFs of policies, procedures, and SOPs
- Exports from systems (e.g., Jira, firewall, AV, AD)

## Best Practices

- Use clear filenames (e.g., `user-access-review-2026Q1.png`)
- Ensure evidence is current and collected during the audit period
- Provide brief notes on context where necessary
